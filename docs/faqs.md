FAQs
========

This page is just meant for general questions that I notice are asked with some frequency. If you feel like something
is missing from here and you'd like to see it included, feel free to ask it by raising an issue on GitHub.

### 1) Why the name "Rosella"? Why the bird names in general?

The bird naming convention is just a bit of a running theme that my supervisor [Ben Woodcroft](https://github.com/wwood)
first came up with. I thought it was cool theme and so I followed suit with the name "Lorikeet" and later [Rosella](https://rhysnewell.github.io/Rosella) 
(which should be named "Ibis" because of bin chickens... Thanks Sam.). 
There is no real meaning behind it, and in some respects it is maybe kind of a bad idea to name your tools after random birds 
with no clear connection between the bird and what the tool does. But also, I hate acronyms and contractions and birds
make for cool logos.

As for why Rosella? It's because my stupid monkey brain thinks that pretty colourful UMAPs look the most like rosellas.
Seriously, I should have named it Ibis. It's a bin a chicken. Missed opportunity honestly.

### 2) Where did the logo come from?

I made it (among other bird based + CoverM logos) using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and based the idea off of this 
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOR7mPwb4I). They are very easy to make so just follow that video if you 
feel like making something similar.

### 3) Where's the paper?

You sound like my supervisor.
